# HW2_CHEM179
Dear Xiao,This assignment was a lot of work in programming and using armadillo, I used Visual Studio as the compiler and followed the settings in the reference link attached at the end, but there were still some problems, I had some path conflicts on my own laptop, so I made sure that the code worked as best as I could, and luckily the output was the same as yours, but with a different decimal place. is the same as yours but with different retained decimal places, more importantly I refer to ChatGPT's output format for this codeframe and refer to some articles and tweets from Extended Huckel Theory, the link will be attached as well, in addition you can let me know if you run into any problems when testing the code, the score does matter to me, especially since I'm This score is really important to me, especially when I apply for PhD position at the end of the year.
I hope all is well in your life on the research path! I have added you to Github.
